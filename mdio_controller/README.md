Both of there are MDIO controllers.

Two different design strategies were employed:

  1. Write the code as a procedual programm (one large state machine).

  This resulted in the inference of latches.

  2. Thinking about the circuit before the design.

  This resulted in a much smaller code base and no latches.

None of these are tested as of yet.
