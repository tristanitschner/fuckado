common components:

* priority encoder with different scheduling schemes (purely combinatorial)
  - round robin
  - lowest index first (first come first served)
  - separate combonent that respects priorities? -> extra priority signal needed (in case of equal priorities -> scheduling again needed)
* multiply
  - by repeated addition
  - newton raphson
* data / stream width converter
* fwft fifo
* packet fifo
  - drop functionality
* stream length inserter
